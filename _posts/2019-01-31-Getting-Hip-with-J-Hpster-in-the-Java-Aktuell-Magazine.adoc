My very first article was published in the german https://www.ijug.eu/de/java-aktuell/[Java Aktuell] 2/2019. Thanks to out scrummaster https://twitter.com/0x4d4175[Marcus] who had the great idea to tell a story. The result is a story about the scrummaster Samu and the jhipster contributor Jennifer. 

If you can read German, you can download and read the article. 

The Java Aktuell is the official community magazine of the http://ijug.eu/[iJUG], the `Association of the German Java User Groups e.V.`. Many thanks to the iJUG for the opportunity to write for the Java Aktuell.
